## React BoxyChat Boilerplate

It is a basic React.js project boilerplate, it uses JSX, React Router, Browserify and SASS.

### Usage
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

or
- `gulp serve`

while if you just need to build `gulp`

### Jsdocs

HTML documentation for js or jsx files with jsdoc style comments from the app/js directory can be generated this way, from root:

- './node_modules/.bin/jsdoc -c conf.json ./app/js -r

An 'out' directory will be created. The directory is gitignored.
